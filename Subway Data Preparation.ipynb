This happens most frequently when there is maintenance on a turnstile, and you can see the numbers jump around in a few different lines when there is maintenance. Our basic steps to dealing with this are to first remove the transactions that don't occur exactly on an hour, difference only transactions that are four hours apart (to avoid including odd entries, such as a door being opened for maintenance, that happen to fall on an exact hours, and then delete any observations that have a first difference that is negative or too large to be an accurate reading.\""
